# CadQuery Designs Aimed for 3D-Printing

## Requirements
* `cadquery` â€“ install it with miniforge/conda for a hassle-free setup
* I use VSCode + OCP CAD Viewer plugin, but `CQ-editor` should work as well

## cq_utils.py
Just a convenient utility module to share code snippets across the designs

## phono-preamp-psu.py
DIY phono-preamp and separate PSU cases

## cone-column.py
Two hollow cone columns, one with a built-in ISO-thread and the other with a recess for a nut. I use these as limiters on my roller shutters.
