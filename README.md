# CadQuery Designs Aimed for 3D-Printing

## Requirements
* `cadquery` â€“ install it with miniforge/conda for a hassle-free setup
* I use VSCode + OCP CAD Viewer plugin, but `CQ-editor` should work as well

> This design is still in development, as soon as it's ready and test prints done, I'll add also a corresponding BOM.

DIY phono-preamp and separate PSU cases. In my setup the PSU unit is only a 15-0-15V transformer, becasue rectifier circuit is > built into the phono-preamp.

For a better noise protection the phono-preamp case should be shielded from inside using an adhesive copper foil, connected finally to the ground terminal.
